Madprops to hubot.  I spent a long time deciding between writing a bot in python and writing a league adapter for hubot.  I decided to do it in python 1) my colleagues use python 2) I don't enjoy reading coffeescript and 3) to flex sharpen my python saw.  Meteor has me writing a lot of js/cs these days

This is my first foray into evented programming in python :D
